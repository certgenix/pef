I want you to update my entire PEF app to follow this role-based flow with 6 dashboards. 
You must use my existing UI system (shadcn/ui, DashboardLayout, cards, buttons, role badges, etc.). 
DO NOT replace or redesign the dashboards; only CONNECT them with the correct logic and features.

────────────────────────────────────────
🔥 OVERALL GOAL
────────────────────────────────────────
Create a complete multi-role ecosystem where the following dashboards exist
and interact with each other:

1. Professionals
2. Job Seekers
3. Employers
4. Business Owners
5. Investors
6. Admin

Implement full role-based routing, permissions, Firestore structure,
and cross-role interactions according to the rules below.

────────────────────────────────────────
🔥 PART 1 — FIRESTORE STRUCTURE (REQUIRED)
────────────────────────────────────────

Use a SIMPLE and ORGANIZED structure:

users/{uid}
  fullName
  email
  country
  roles: { professional, jobSeeker, employer, businessOwner, investor, admin }
  profileCompleted
  professionalData: {...}
  jobSeekerData: {...}
  employerData: {...}
  businessOwnerData: {...}
  investorData: {...}

jobPosts/{id}
  employerId
  title
  description
  location
  requirements
  applicants: [uid]

businessOpportunities/{id}
  ownerId
  title
  description
  investmentNeeded
  collaboratorsNeeded
  interestedInvestors: [uid]

NO OTHER COLLECTIONS should be needed.

────────────────────────────────────────
🔥 PART 2 — ROLE-BASED ACCESS RULES
────────────────────────────────────────

Apply these ability rules:

Professionals:
  ✓ Can view business opportunities
  ✓ Can view job posts (preview only)
  ✓ Can network with all roles
  ✘ Cannot apply to jobs unless role=jobSeeker

Job Seekers:
  ✓ Can apply to job posts
  ✓ Can create CV/resume
  ✓ Can view employer profiles

Employers:
  ✓ Can create job posts
  ✓ Can view job seekers
  ✓ Can manage applicants

Business Owners:
  ✓ Can post business opportunities
  ✓ Can view professionals
  ✓ Can view investors

Investors:
  ✓ Can view business opportunities
  ✓ Can save/bookmark opportunities
  ✓ Can contact business owners

Admin:
  ✓ Full access to everything
  ✓ Can approve/delete posts
  ✓ Can modify user roles
  ✓ Can view analytics

────────────────────────────────────────
🔥 PART 3 — ROUTES THAT MUST BE ADDED
────────────────────────────────────────

Create or update the following routes:

/dashboard/professional
/dashboard/job-seeker
/dashboard/employer
/dashboard/business-owner
/dashboard/investor
/dashboard/admin

/job/create
/job/:id
/job/:id/applicants

/business/create
/business/:id
/business/:id/investors

/profile/complete
/profile/edit

/admin/users
/admin/user/:uid
/admin/analytics

────────────────────────────────────────
🔥 PART 4 — CONNECT ALL DASHBOARDS WITH LOGIC
────────────────────────────────────────

Implement the following flows:

A. Employers → Job Seekers
   - Employers can post jobs
   - Job seekers can apply
   - Employers can view applicants

B. Business Owners → Investors
   - Business owners can post opportunities
   - Investors can view and respond
   - Store interestedInvestors array

C. Business Owners → Professionals
   - Business owners can browse professionals
   - Professionals can be invited for collaborations

D. Employers → Professionals
   - Professionals can see company profiles
   - No apply button unless they have jobSeeker role

E. Admin → Everyone
   - Manage all data
   - Change user roles
   - Delete posts

────────────────────────────────────────
🔥 PART 5 — PROTECTEDROUTE IMPROVEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────

Modify ProtectedRoute:

- If user is logged in but profileCompleted=false → redirect to /profile/complete
- If user is not logged in → redirect to login
- If user tries to access a dashboard they do not have permission for → redirect to /dashboard

────────────────────────────────────────
🔥 PART 6 — PAGES YOU MUST GENERATE
────────────────────────────────────────

Generate the following FULL pages/components:

1. Job Create Page (Employer)
2. Job View Page (all roles, with role-based actions)
3. Applicants Page (Employer only)
4. Business Opportunity Create Page
5. Business Opportunity View Page (role-based visibility)
6. Investor Interest Button
7. Browse Professionals Page
8. Browse Job Seekers Page
9. Browse Employers Page
10. Admin User List
11. Admin User Detail Editor
12. Profile Complete Page
13. Profile Edit Page

Use my existing UI patterns.

────────────────────────────────────────
🔥 PART 7 — OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIRED
────────────────────────────────────────

Please output:

1. Updated routing config
2. All new components and pages
3. Firestore read/write logic
4. Role-based view logic
5. Updated ProtectedRoute
6. Any required context/hook updates
7. Clean Firestore security rules for all roles

────────────────────────────────────────
🔥 FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────

DO NOT break my current dashboards.
Just CONNECT them and add missing pages.

DO NOT redesign UI.
Use my existing components.

Write clean, optimized, production-ready React + TypeScript code.
