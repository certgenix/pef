Professional Executive Forum (PEF) – Business Overview
Now with five user roles, all selectable by a single person.
PEF is a global digital platform that collects structured information from professionals at all levels — including job seekers, employers, business owners, and investors — and uses that data to later power intelligent opportunity matching.
This creates a massive, high-quality global database of talent, business opportunities, and investment prospects.

🔍 How the Multi-Role System Works (Simple Explanation)
When a person registers:
1.	They enter basic information (name, country, email).
2.	They select their roles (any combination).
3.	For each role, the system asks a few short, relevant questions:
o	Investor → investment size, industries
o	Employer → job positions they are offering
o	Job Seeker → fields they are applying to
o	Business Owner → business details, partnership needs
o	Professional → skills, experience
The platform stores all role data under one single profile.
No separate accounts.
No duplication.
No confusion.
